<h2>Why did the chicken cross the street?</h2>

<enfase>This is a genetic algorithm that aims to create a chicken that is able to cross the street.</enfase>
<p>A genome contains a combination of directions that a chicken must follow, with the passing of generations, these genomes are selected and those that can reach farther are crossed. This is not a perfect algorithm. Maybe the chicken are not smart enough, i will try with mice...</p>
